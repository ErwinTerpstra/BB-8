# BB-8
After seeing The Force Awakens for the first time I was immediately enamoured by the new Astromech droid they've introduced. Besides the usual charm they are somehow always able to add to their droid, I also found it intriguing on a technical level. This made we want to try building one myself.

The project contains a basic RC controllable robot with support for driving three and auto balancing. It runs on the Arduino platform.
